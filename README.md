# Helm Chart to cdk8s migration example

This repository is my attempt to migrate a helm chart (for mysql) to a cdk8s module. If you'd like to read more about it
check out [the blog post](https://www.openconstructfoundation.org//helm-to-cdk8s/) on [the Open Construct Foundation](https://www.openconstructfoundation.org/).

## Design Notes

This code is not meant to be totally production worthy. There is a lot of refactoring I'd do to make things more 
readable and maintainable.

## How to use

In it's current state, you shouldn't. But if you want to use this an example for how to migrate a helm chart to cdk8s, 
go right ahead.
